# Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), determine if a person could attend all meetings.

'''Input:
[[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]

Sorted intervals:
After sorting by start times:
[[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]

Check overlaps:

Compare [5, 10] with [0, 30] â†’ Overlap!
(Meeting 2 starts at 5 but Meeting 1 ends at 30)
Return False. '''

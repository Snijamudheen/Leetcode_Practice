'''Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.'''

            # For string 's', increase the count of the character by 1

            # For string 't', do the same
            countt[t[i]] = 1 + countt.get(t[i], 0)

        # Now compare the character counts in both dictionaries
        for c in counts:
            # If a character's count in 's' doesn't match its count in 't', return False
            # If the key c does not exist in the countt dictionary, using countt[c] will raise a KeyError.
            # Using .get(c, 0) ensures that if c isnâ€™t found in countt, it will return 0 instead of throwing an error.
            if counts[c] != countt.get(c, 0):
                return False

        # If all character counts match, return True
